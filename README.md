The space-time picture of hadron formation in high-energy collisions with nuclear
targets is still poorly known. The tests of hadron formation was suggested for the
first stage of SPD running. They will require measuring charged pion and proton
spectra with the precision better than 10%. A research has been carried out to check
feasibility of such studies at SPD. In this work, 12C − 12C and 40Ca − 40Ca heavy ion
collisions at center of mass energy of 11 GeV/nucleon were simulated using the SMASH
event generator. Firstly, the generator-level events were studied. The distribution of
track multiplicities and momentum distributions of different types of charged particles
were obtained. Secondly, the generated events passed through the full reconstruction
using the SpdRoot framework. At this stage particles were identified using dE/dx
measurement and time-of-flight information. It allowed us to estimate charge track
multiplicities in the tracking system and purities of charge particles spectra. The results
on multiplicity are important to estimate occupancies in the tracking system, while the
results on the pion and proton momentum spectra show that particle identification
should be acceptable for validation of hadron formation models. This is the first study
of moderate ion collisions for the SPD Collaboration.
