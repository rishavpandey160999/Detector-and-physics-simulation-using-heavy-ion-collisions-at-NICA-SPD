Research work was performed at Dzhelepov Laboratory in JINR Moscow under the supervision of Dr. Igor Denisenko. The aim of the research was to check the performance of tracking systems (dE/dx and TOF) and to estimate the feasibility for the studies of hadron formation effects at the first stage of NICA-SPD.
